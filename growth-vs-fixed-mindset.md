# Nature Vs. Nurture: Challening Growth or Fixated Content

1. #####Intro
    1.  "Not Yet" that was the grade given to students who did not get an "A" on the project. "Not Yet"? What does that imply, how does that help students? Is that even quantifiable? Yet that phrase has helped students improve their grades, their confidence, and their ability to grow into contributing members to society. Mabe we adults could even change mindsets to improve lives.

2. #####Body
    1. What is Growth vs. Fixed mindset?
        1. Growth is giving a individual opportunity to improve by not boxing them into a way of thinking. An example would be you tried really hard and it shows, keep it up! or even "Not Yet" to a student who isn't fairing to well.
        2. Fixed is giving a individual a box. Telling them this is what they are good at, and what they need to live up too.
    2. Growth Mindset Improves Lives
        1. Scientist ran brain tests on students. When given an error students who were taught a growth mindset would study the error learn from it. On the other end of the spectrum were students taught in a fixed mindset. Those student would avoid the problem.
        2. Brains built stronger neuron links improving intelligence and brain function. No longer are people restricted by what some test or person says their IQ is.
    3. Not too late
        1. Are we raising our childeren to get "A's", win at sports? We can begin - instead - saying you did well, you really tried and hey great game, did you have fun? Ask questions engage their minds.
        2. Quit rewarding everything, and compliment effort. Even as leaders and managers we could challenge our crew and engage them for better quality work, improved moral ( Free tip for you current or future business leader - that means more profit and improved margin!).
3. #####Closing
    1.Even as adults we can learn. Take a chance. Make a career change. Challenge ourselves, try our best, and practice we can get there!
