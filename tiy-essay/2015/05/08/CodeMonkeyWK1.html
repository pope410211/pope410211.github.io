We ended the week with some JavaScript projects due on Monday and visit from the developer(s) and CEO of Echo. That was exciting to see the how an agency worked, to learn a little bit of what it will be like when we graduate in a few months!</p></div><div class=related><h2>Related Posts</h2><ul class=related-posts><li><h3><a href=/website/2015/08/06/test.html>Testing <small>06 Aug 2015</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=/tiy-essay/2015/06/18/A-Link-Between-Info.html>A Link Between Info <small>18 Jun 2015</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=/tiy-essay/2015/06/11/No-Name.html>No-Name <small>11 Jun 2015</small></a></h3></li></ul></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
