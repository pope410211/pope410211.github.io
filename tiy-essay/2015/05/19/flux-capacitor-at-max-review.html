Week two came, difficulty went up too dark souls but we got through it. JavaScript was my biggest weekness, yet I was improving the command line use. I was looking forward to the Front End Conference in St. Pete the following week.</p><p>Week three came difficulty level increases to Ghost&rsquo;s &lsquo;n Goblins. The css was fun, but the work was piling on, I felt it piling on and realized that as my usual I was totally cocky and over confident - not as helpful in code as it is in hospitality. But I let it fall so I could soak up the info from this conference we were going to!</p><p>The conference was awesome did some networking, met Val Head, and some other great coders and developers!( it was unfortunate that I did not get an opportunity to meet James White w/ signalnoise - potentially the coolest canadian! - also goes w/ the stereotype of Canadians being a little behind in times&hellip;). After the weekend I felt like I was behind, and worked to get caught up to hopefully bewhere I am now, I guess we shall see&hellip;</p></div><div class=related><h2>Related Posts</h2><ul class=related-posts><li><h3><a href=/website/2015/08/06/test.html>Testing <small>06 Aug 2015</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=/tiy-essay/2015/06/18/A-Link-Between-Info.html>A Link Between Info <small>18 Jun 2015</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=/tiy-essay/2015/06/11/No-Name.html>No-Name <small>11 Jun 2015</small></a></h3></li></ul></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
