## READING API's

1. How does API handle authentication?
    * Do I need to authenticate?
    * What can I do with an unauthenticated request?
    * How can I authenticate my request? (3-ways)
2. How do I ask API for information..
    * The profile information for a specific user?
    * The repository listing for a specific user?
    * The recent, public activity for a specific user?
3. Is there a limit to the number of request I can make?
    * Is there a way of extending that limit?
    * What happens when I hit the limit?
4. What if there is a lot of data returned?
    * How can I ask for more (or less) data from a request?
    * How do I know that there is more data available?
