### **Getting Some Java!** :coffee:
##### *What is Java Script?*
  A dynamic scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. Sometimes referred to as *JS* (for the purpose of this resource we will use *JS* instead of Javascript). [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  
  Now that we have an idea of what *JS* is, lets learn some BASIC commands and what they do!
###### *Basic*
1. [Argument](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Argument)
    * An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.
2. [Variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable)
    * A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
3. [Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function)
    * A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return an output. A function in JavaScript is also an object. An example of a function are **`()`** & **`{}`**.


###### *Basic Literal Types*
1. [*null*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)
    * The value null  is a *JS* literal representing null or "empty value", i.e. no object value is present. It's one *JS's* primitive values.
2. [*Boolean*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/boolean)
    * Evaluates and expression and returns as true or false
3. [*Number*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
    * Is the numeric type in the [double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEE 754)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format). (We'll get more into that later!).
4. [*String*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
    * Sequence of characters used to to represent text. In *JS* it is a primitive value and the String object is a wrapper around a String primitive.


###### *Built-In Constants*
1. [*Undefined*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/undefined)
    * A primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
2. [*NaN*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/NaN)
    * NaN (not a number) is a numeric data type that means an undefined value or value that cannot be represented, especially results of floating-point calculations.
3. [*Infinity*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity)
    * The global Infinity property is a numeric value representing infinity.
