### **Getting Some Java!** :coffee:
##### *What is Java Script?*
  A dynamic scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. Sometimes referred to as *JS* (for the purpose of this resource we will use *JS* instead of Javascript). [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  
  Now that we have an idea of what *JS* is, lets learn some BASIC commands and what they do!
  
###### *Basic Literal Types*
1. [*null*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)
    * The value null  is a *JS* literal representing null or "empty value", i.e. no object value is present. It's one *JS's* primitive values.
2. [*Boolean*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/boolean)
    * Evaluates and expression and returns as true or false
3. [*Number*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
    * Is the numeric type in the [double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEE 754)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format). (We'll get more into that later!).
4. [*String*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
    * Sequence of characters used to to represent text. In *JS* it is a primitive value and the String object is a wrapper around a String primitive.
