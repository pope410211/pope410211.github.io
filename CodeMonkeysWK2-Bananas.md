#Peeling the Banana!

 * What did we learn in Week 2 at The Iron Yard Orlando?
    * JavaScript deconstructing a website
    * How to deny Wallstreet (or what ever online NewsPaper he was on) their ad
    revenue!
    * We worked more on User Stories
    * Nested accordions only sound and look good when professional musicians play
    them.
    * That roughly 7 of us are going to the FEE Conference in St. Pete!
    * Actually working face to face w/ your team is invaluable.
    * I still break everything.
    * I wish I knew this past week that on week 3 we would learn the easy way
    to fix a merge conflict!
 * End of Outline!
