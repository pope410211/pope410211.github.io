  <li>What did we learn in Week 2 at The Iron Yard Orlando?
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript deconstructing a website</li>
      <li>How to deny Wallstreet (or what ever online NewsPaper he was on) their ad
 revenue!</li>
      <li>We worked more on User Stories</li>
      <li>Nested accordions only sound and look good when professional musicians play
 them.</li>
      <li>That roughly 7 of us are going to the FEE Conference in St. Pete!</li>
      <li>Actually working face to face w/ your team is invaluable.</li>
      <li>I still break everything.</li>
      <li>I wish I knew this past week that on week 3 we would learn the easy way
 to fix a merge conflict!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>End of Outline!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="rough">ROUGH</h1>

<p>In week 2 we began to peel back the code like a banana, start deconsrtucting web pages and rebuilding- I guess its not really like a banana. One of the best/most entertaining moments in the education was watching all the ads of wallstreet journal(or whateever online newspaper) disappear, denying ad revenue. We created and worked more on user stories which were fun, and I feell I have down pretty well. Howevere that leads us to the following message:</p>

<p>Only professionals should mess with accordions. Not sure what I did I broke something (see later in this journal). We have been able to open and close the Nested accordions, have arrows, etc. There was a lot of JavaScript this week. It was great albeit fairly challenging for me, and I know I am not feeling fully prepared in the world of JavaScripts - Yet.</p>

<p>Front End Design conference in St. Pete – Woo! So it turns out about 70% of the class is going to St. Pete for this conference (Road Trip and I don’t have to drive even more awesome - THANK YOU @jessyriordan). We are all looking forward to this conference to learn, network, and the experience.  Further we will still be able to work face to face. A invaluable tool that is beyond helpful for me.</p>

<p>So like I said above, I break a lot of things, and try to fix them. Week one, was more of a lets get into this and break everything we can and I learn to fix it…I have fixed some of the things, I think I am ahead in broken commits. But I have finally learned to merge (Yes!).</p>
