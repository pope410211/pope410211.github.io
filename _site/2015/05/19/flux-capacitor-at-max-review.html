    <p>Week 3,</p>

<p>Looking back, when I started the Iron Yard on May the fourth ( I did hope the fourth
  was with me!) excited, thinking this will be tough but not as bad as it was implied…
  Week one went by fast enough and seemed to meet my idea of how tough it would be - Legend of Zelda: OOT.
  Week two came, difficulty went up too dark souls but we got through it. JavaScript was
  my biggest weekness, yet I was improving the command line use. I was looking forward to
  the Front End Conference in St. Pete the following week.</p>

<p>Week three came difficulty level increases to Ghost’s ‘n Goblins. The css was fun, but the
  work was piling on, I felt it piling on and realized that as my usual I was totally cocky
  and over confident - not as helpful in code as it is in hospitality. But I let it fall
  so I could soak up the info from this conference we were going to!</p>

<p>The conference was awesome did some networking, met Val Head, and some other great coders
  and developers!( it was unfortunate that I did not get an opportunity to meet James White w/ signalnoise - potentially the coolest canadian! - also goes w/ the stereotype of Canadians being a little behind in times…). After the weekend I felt like I was behind, and worked to get caught up to hopefully bewhere I am now, I guess we shall see…</p>
