  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Hello World! I know in October I said I would try to write a blog, and do so more often. Truth is, I am not one for writing blogs, or even journaling often. But as I write this, I realize, what I need to do is write more about <code>code</code> and technologies that I am working on. This post will not be on technologies, however, just a fresh update.</p>

<p>Shortly after writing my last post, I was hired by Omniticket | Best Union s.p.a.  - they are an Italian based ticketing company. One of the largest in the world, they - we - handle ticketing for everything - theaters, museums, theme parks, education centers, sporting events. We do web sales, and physical sales. The tech stack is <code>ColdFusion</code> which took me by surprise - I mean I had heard of cold fusion. It was rather easy to learn though - we also use <code>mySQL express</code>, <code>css</code> and <code>css</code> frameworks like <code>bootstrap</code>. So after I began , I took time to learn ColdFusion, be able to debug and write it, learn to program using a Windows 8 PC, and finally to use <code>Tortoise SVN</code> (not <code>GIT</code>). I also went in with an excitement to learn - and the G.M. saw that. I helped to develop passbook <code>.pkpass</code> for apple iPhone/iPad. I was even added to our B2B project as the Lead U.I. Developer. We decided as a team to use <code>Angularjs</code> as our front end tech stack. I decided to instead of using bootstrap, as was the usual, to use <code>Angular Material</code>(https://material.angularjs.org/latest/). A material design framework. The project is still in the works, and is being designed mobile first, and scaled to Desktop.  So that is a quick update where I am at for work - I have a lot I am working on and learning, it has been a great experience.</p>

<p>What&#39;s next? Things are finally settling down. In the past 6 months, I got married, moved, started my first job in a new career field, learned a new programming language, and went to my sis-in-laws wedding so it has been busy. I want to return to <code>GIT</code> which I miss very much, and start working on personal projects. Starting with redoing this portfolio page, I want to continue and learn <code>Python</code>, review my <code>JavaScript</code> which I am sad to say is a bit rusty, and finally review and continue work on my <code>Lords of the Round Table</code> and take it live with <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>  I can be proud of. </p>

<p>Till next time, live long, and code.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>--- Nick  </p>
