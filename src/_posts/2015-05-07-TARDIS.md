# Time and Reflective Dimension In Space = T.A.R.D.I.S.

In the past five weeks at The Iron Yard, we have worked hard, busted our brains, studied when we wanted
to sleep, gave up our jobs, time with family, and what do we have to show... Before and even during our
"break" if you asked us do we know anything, we probably would have answered..no. But the reality is,
we learned A LOT - we built a blog template - none ready to ship (unless you're @gatorpazz who should also read this and give it a :+1: ) But we made them!
We practiced our skill and started from scratch, it was great review and great learning opportunity. My only
regret is that I didnt spend more time on the JavaScript, but I am confident in my ability, and that of my
cohorts to learn it, and become an awesome Junior Developer...or Their Boss...

<!-- ##Outline:
