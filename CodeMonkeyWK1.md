# Wk 1 Rough

Week one started off with tons of excitement, and some extreme nervousness.
I was nervous about my level of coding experience compared to the other
students that would be there, yet I was pleasantly surprised to see I was at the
same level roughly. The day began maybe even more excited to begin training for
my new career!

We were told how tough the course would be, told we would be like drowning kitt-
ens. After the first day it was kind of like you know we have got this, we are
going to rock these 12 weeks - the end of the week began to prove us wrong.

We started off with terminal and moved to JavaScript and attempting to create a
String Calculator and todo list web app. We stared the todo.js with planning,
which involved users stories. An example of which is "A Smurf can Smurf so that
Smurfs can Smurf" (or "A Someone can do this so that somone can benefit").

After the user stories and plan what the something can do we start the small
processes and do "YAGNI" - You Aint Gunna Need It - pulling ideas from the task
that won't necessarily affect its purpose (the pieces that are more for show/or
show off what you can do). Still working on Extreme Programming.
