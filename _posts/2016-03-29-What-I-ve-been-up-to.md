Hello World! I know in October I said I would try to write a blog, and do so more often. Truth is, I am not one for writing blogs, or even journaling often. But as I write this, I realize, what I need to do is write more about `code` and technologies that I am working on. This post will not be on technologies, however, just a fresh update.

Shortly after writing my last post, I was hired by Omniticket | Best Union s.p.a.  - they are an Italian based ticketing company. One of the largest in the world, they - we - handle ticketing for everything - theaters, museums, theme parks, education centers, sporting events. We do web sales, and physical sales. The tech stack is `ColdFusion` which took me by surprise - I mean I had heard of cold fusion. It was rather easy to learn though - we also use `mySQL express`, `css` and `css` frameworks like `bootstrap`. So after I began , I took time to learn ColdFusion, be able to debug and write it, learn to program using a Windows 8 PC, and finally to use `Tortoise SVN` (not `GIT`). I also went in with an excitement to learn - and the G.M. saw that. I helped to develop passbook `.pkpass` for apple iPhone/iPad. I was even added to our B2B project as the Lead U.I. Developer. We decided as a team to use `Angularjs` as our front end tech stack. I decided to instead of using bootstrap, as was the usual, to use `Angular Material`(https://material.angularjs.org/latest/). A material design framework. The project is still in the works, and is being designed mobile first, and scaled to Desktop.  So that is a quick update where I am at for work - I have a lot I am working on and learning, it has been a great experience.

What's next? Things are finally settling down. In the past 6 months, I got married, moved, started my first job in a new career field, learned a new programming language, and went to my sis-in-laws wedding so it has been busy. I want to return to `GIT` which I miss very much, and start working on personal projects. Starting with redoing this portfolio page, I want to continue and learn `Python`, review my `JavaScript` which I am sad to say is a bit rusty, and finally review and continue work on my `Lords of the Round Table` and take it live with `<code>`  I can be proud of. 

Till next time, live long, and code.

Best,
