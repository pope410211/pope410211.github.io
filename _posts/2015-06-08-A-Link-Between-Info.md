## What is my favorite link to use thus far? [**CSS TRICKS**](https://css-tricks.com/)

Why? It is awesome. As the name implies it has tips and *tricks* for CSS and various
other languages. When it came to spacing and or various needs for CSS I would often
go and review Chris Coyer's blog, and explanations ( and other authors, I am sure, I am bad at
  verifying who the authors were). The information is generally relevant, easy to follow ( with basic - intermediate CSS). And for information that wasn't understood it would be easier to find the information on the subject.
