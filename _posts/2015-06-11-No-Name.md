### MY journal....

Time flies! I couldn't believe it is already week 7! Wow! It is hard to believe
how much we have learned. And as end near, and the start of our new careers on
the horizon, it is hard to feel fully ready for that day! I think most of us (probably all)
are nervous about being ready to enter the field. However recently working with these API's and building websites from scratch have improved our self confidence in programming!
